# CLIJ3: GPU-accelerated image processing for everyone

> [!WARNING]
> CLIJ3 is still in development and may not yet ready to use for your research project. Yet feel free to try it, feedback are very welcomed!

CLIJ3 is a GPU-accelerated image processing library for [ImageJ/Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). 
It comes with hundreds of operations for 
[filtering](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__filter), 
[binarizing](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__binary),
[labeling](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__label),
[measuring](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__measurement) in images,
[projections](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__project),
[transformations](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__transform) and 
[mathematical operations](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__math) for images. 
While most of these are classical image processing operations, CLIJ3 also allows performing operations on 
[matrices](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__matrix) potentially representing
[neighborhood relationships](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference__neighbor) between [cells](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/md/neighbors_of_neighbors) and pixels.

Under the hood it uses [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) and rely on the [clEsperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto) project.

## Plugin Installation

CLIJ3 requires you to have [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) installed on your computer and up-to-date.
Install CLIJ3 by adding the CLIJ3 update site to your Fiji and apply the changes.
After restarting Fiji, CLIJ3 should be installed and ready to use.

> [!WARNING]
> CLIJ3 being under development, its update site is currently unlisted. If you want to install it you will need to add the update site `https://imagej.net/clij3` manually.

## Build and Install from source

Git clone the repository, and build the project using maven: `mvn clean install -U`.

If you want `maven` to update your local Fiji after the build, please update the `pom.xml` file with your local Fiji ([here](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij3/blob/9f30fb3267e51d811792d2094d88f8d735498dd3/pom.xml#L86)). Rerun `mvn install` to install the plugin to your Fiji.

Once CLIJ3 installed, you should be execute example scripts like [this one](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij3/blob/main/demo/basic_demo.py) in your Fiji script editor.
